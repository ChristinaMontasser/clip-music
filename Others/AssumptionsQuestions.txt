ASSUMPTION:
Because the lack of domain analysis, I have assumed some things...

1. The importance of ticks likelhoods, which have been given in ticks command, is
not clear to me, I have assumed that's the probablity for actions in each clip. Therefore, 
instead of using only the "chance", I use both the given likelihood and the chance 
probability, that I calculate, between the two actions.


2. I assumed that music is played once tick command is typed. 

3. The generated music is depend only on clips that are saved right before 
the tick command. 

4. There are a lot of "try" and "catch" and others scenerios shouls be thought of, 
but I have been struggling and spending 3 days working on incompatibilty problems 
among google test, CMake an compiler.
