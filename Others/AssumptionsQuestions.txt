ASSUMPTION:
Because of the lack of domain analysis, I have assumed some things...

1. The importance of ticks' likelhood, which has been given in ticks command, is
not clear to me, I have assumed that's the probability for actions in each clip. Therefore, 
instead of using only the "chance", I use both the given likelihood and the chance 
probability, that I calculate, between the two actions.


2. I assumed that music is played once the tick command is typed. 

3. The generated music does depend only on clips that are saved right before 
the tick command. 

4. There are a lot of "try" and "catch" and other scenerios shouls be thought of.
